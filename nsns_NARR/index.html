      <h2 id="about-project-heading">About the Project</h2>
  
      <p>
        <strong>“Emerging from the Shadows”</strong> is a national initiative led by <strong>NorthStar Special Needs Society</strong> as part of <strong>National AccessAbility Week 2025 and 2026</strong>. Through a series of themed workshops, panel discussions, and community events, the project aims to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and foster inclusion for individuals with disabilities within Asian-Canadian communities.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The project unfolds in two phases: <strong>Year One (2025)</strong> focuses on speakers, families, and advocates primarily from Ontario; <strong>Year Two (2026)</strong> expands to include voices and perspectives from across Canada, deepening the conversation nationally.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        While NorthStar's core work centers on children with autism, this initiative is designed to resonate across the broader disability community, creating space for shared understanding and solidarity.
      </p>
  
      <h3>A Distinctly Asian-Canadian Cultural Focus</h3>
  
      <p>
        In many Asian cultures, disability is still associated with stigma, silence, or shame. Deeply rooted cultural norms may lead families to hide disabled members, limit access to services, and isolate them from community life. Language barriers, fear of judgment, and a lack of culturally relevant supports often compound these challenges.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This silence causes harm — not just to individuals with disabilities, but to their families and communities. It hinders inclusion and reinforces systemic inequities.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This project responds by creating space for open dialogue, education, and storytelling — rooted in cultural understanding and focused on building more inclusive futures.

      <h2 id="about-project-heading">About the Project</h2>
  
      <p>
        <strong>“Emerging from the Shadows”</strong> is a national initiative led by <strong>NorthStar Special Needs Society</strong> as part of <strong>National AccessAbility Week 2025 and 2026</strong>. Through a series of themed workshops, panel discussions, and community events, the project aims to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and foster inclusion for individuals with disabilities within Asian-Canadian communities.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The project unfolds in two phases: <strong>Year One (2025)</strong> focuses on speakers, families, and advocates primarily from Ontario; <strong>Year Two (2026)</strong> expands to include voices and perspectives from across Canada, deepening the conversation nationally.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        While NorthStar's core work centers on children with autism, this initiative is designed to resonate across the broader disability community, creating space for shared understanding and solidarity.
      </p>
  
      <h3>A Distinctly Asian-Canadian Cultural Focus</h3>
  
      <p>
        In many Asian cultures, disability is still associated with stigma, silence, or shame. Deeply rooted cultural norms may lead families to hide disabled members, limit access to services, and isolate them from community life. Language barriers, fear of judgment, and a lack of culturally relevant supports often compound these challenges.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This silence causes harm — not just to individuals with disabilities, but to their families and communities. It hinders inclusion and reinforces systemic inequities.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        This project responds by creating space for open dialogue, education, and storytelling — rooted in cultural understanding and focused on building more inclusive futures.
